# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the **Titanic dataset** to predict which passengers survived the tragedy using machine learning.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Binary Classification (Survived/Not Survived)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

---

## ðŸ§  Outcome

Built a **Logistic Regression model** that predicts survival with solid accuracy using passenger data like gender, age, class, and more.
