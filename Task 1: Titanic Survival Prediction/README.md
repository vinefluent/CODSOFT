# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the **Titanic dataset** to predict which passengers survived the tragedy using machine learning and visualizes insights with **Power BI**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
- **Power BI** (for dashboard and visuals)

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression Model
- Binary Classification (Survived / Dead)
- Accuracy Score & Confusion Matrix
- Data Visualization with Power BI

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

The interactive dashboard includes:

- Total Survivors vs Non-Survivors
- Survival by Gender, Class, and Age
- Filters (Slicers): Sex, Pclass, Embarked
- Age Distribution (Bar chart)
- Styled with dark theme and rounded visuals

🖼️ See `Dashboard.PNG` for preview  
📁 Open `Taitanic.pbix` in Power BI Desktop

---

## 🧠 Outcome

Built a **logistic regression model** with good prediction accuracy. Used Power BI to make the insights easy to understand through visuals.
